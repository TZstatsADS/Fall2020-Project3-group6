### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Summary: Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for facial emotion recognition. The goal of this project is to accurately classify an emotion shown from a facial image is simple emotion or compound emotion. We started from a baseline model using the Gradient Boosting Machine and the accuracy was 73.7%. There are 6006 features in total, so we did feature selection, including forward stepwise selection, Lasso, and PCA, to reduce the dimention of the dataset. Then, we tried several different models, including Native Bayes, Random Forest, LDA, XGBoost, SVM, DNN. Models were evaluated in terms of accuracy and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). Compare the results of each model, we chose Xgboost as our advanced model and improved the accuracy to 86.8%.

[Contribution Statement] All of us contributed design of the study and participate all the stages of this project. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
